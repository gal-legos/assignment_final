# Final Project Overview 
This projects objective was to create a design-focused cloud architecture application. My chosen scenario was for a healthcare application that allows patients to submit daily symptom reports and optionally integrate wearable device data. The system aggregates patient-reported and wearable data, generates summaries, and flags alerts that are visible only to authorized healthcare providers. The solution is designed using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and emphasizes scalability, security, and cost efficiency while remaining within the scope of a student mini-capstone project.
